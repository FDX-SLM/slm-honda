"""Direct model-vs-model win-rate (head-to-head) from saved evaluation answers.

Reuses the per-sample answers each evaluation already writes (``per_sample.csv``), so a head-to-
head (e.g. our SLM vs the parent Qwen) needs **no re-generation** — only judge ``compare`` calls.
Convention: model **A** is the model under test, model **B** the baseline/parent; a "win" means A
was judged better than B. Cases are aligned by ``id`` present in both runs.
