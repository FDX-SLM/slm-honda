"""Data mixing and curriculum construction for SFT.

Two concerns:

* **Single/multi-turn mixing** — sample SFT records so the multi-turn / single-turn ratio
  matches the configured target (e.g. ~2/3 multi-turn), without replacement and seeded for
  reproducibility.
* **Curriculum staging** — build the ordered list of stages (e.g. stage 1 broad ``sft``;
  stage 2 ``sft`` + ``reasoning`` with ``<think>`` folding). Each stage selects records by
  ``include`` type and carries its mixing ratio + thinking flag for the trainer.
